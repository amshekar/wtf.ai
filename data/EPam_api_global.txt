EPAM’s API Security Assessment

Ensuring Security is at the Center of Your API Strategy

Web APIs have emerged as one of the leading vectors of cyberattacks. EPAM’s API Security Assessment helps you lock down API definitions to reduce attack surface and remove any gaps in your defense.
We leverage the market-leading 42crunch API security platform to perform static analysis on your top 15 APIs’ definitions.
After the assessment, EPAM will provide you with a report that outlines security concerns and recommendations.
EPAM’s Assessment Reviews Your API Definitions on Three Levels

API Format

Are your APIs valid and well-formed files?
Do they follow best practices?
Can they be parsed, reviewed or protected? 
Security

How good are the security definitions in your APIs?
Have you defined authentication and authorization methods?
Is your protocol secure enough?
Data Validation

What is the quality of your APIs’ data definitions?
How well have you defined what data your APIs accept as input or can include in the output they produce?
How strong are the schemas you have defined for your APIs and their parameters?
