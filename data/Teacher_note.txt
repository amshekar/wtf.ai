Dear Teacher, 
I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for being the first and most exceptional teacher
to my child, wtf. As a family, we were initially apprehensive about our child's adjustment as
we relocated from India to the USA, with a new language, culture, and school system. 
However, your unwavering support and guidance have been instrumental in wtf's growth and development. 
Thank you for being a remarkable educator and making a positive impact on our lives.

we are forever grateful for everything you have done for wtf."
